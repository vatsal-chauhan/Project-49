        <center><h4>Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.

            There are around 160 species of chameleon.
            
            Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.
            
            Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are also found in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida.
            
            Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.
            
            Chameleon change color for camouflage but this is not always the main reason. Some show darker colors when angry, or when trying to scare others. Males show light multi-colored patterns when vying for female attention. Desert varieties change to black when its cooler to absorb heat, then a light grey to reflect heat.
            
            Chameleons have amazing eyes. The bulging upper and lower eyelids are joined and the pupil peaks out from a pinhole sized gap.
            
            The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different objects at the same time. This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.
            
            Chameleons actual eyesight is great they can see small insects 5-10 meters away. They can also see in both visible and ultraviolet light.</h4></center>

        <img src="F:\Projects\Project 49\images\camel">
        <br>
        <center><h4>	There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
            	Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
            	Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.
            	Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.
            	Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.
            	Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!
            	When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.
            	Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.
            	Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!

        <center><h4>
            •	Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
            •	Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.
            •	Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.
            •	Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.
            •	Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. Both sexes take turn incubating the eggs and both feed the chicks ‘pigeon milk’ – a special secretion from the lining of the crop which both sexes produce.
            •	Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.

        <a href="http://origami.me/panda/"><img src="F:\Projects\Project 49\images\panda"></a>
        <br>
        <center><h4>. These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.
             Family time! Female pandas give birth to one or two cubs every two years. Cubs stay with their mothers for 18 months before venturing off on their own!
             Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. When winter approaches, they head lower down their mountain homes to warmer temperatures, where they continue to chomp away on bamboo
             Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!
             The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.
             Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.
             Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.
             It’s thought that these magnificent mammals are solitary animals, with males and females only coming together briefly to mate. Recent research, however, suggests that giant pandas occasionally meet outside of breeding season, and communicate with each other through scent marks and calls. </h4></center>
